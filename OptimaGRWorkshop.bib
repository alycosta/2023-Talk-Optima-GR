  abstract = {Solving multicommodity capacitated network design problems is a hard task that requires the use of several strategies like relaxing some constraints and strengthening the model with valid inequalities. In this paper, we compare three sets of inequalities that have been widely used in this context: Benders, metric and cutset inequalities. We show that Benders inequalities associated to extreme rays are metric inequalities. We also show how to strengthen Benders inequalities associated to non-extreme rays to obtain metric inequalities. We show that cutset inequalities are Benders inequalities, but not necessarily metric inequalities. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a cutset inequality to be a metric inequality. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of strengthening Benders and cutset inequalities to obtain metric inequalities.},

  abstract = {Benders decomposition is a broadly used exact solution method for stochastic programs, which has been increasingly applied to solve transportation and logistics planning problems under uncertainty. However, this strategy comes with important drawbacks, such as a weak master problem following the relaxation step that confines the dual cuts to the scenario subproblems. In this paper, we propose a partial Benders decomposition methodology, based on the idea of including explicit information from the scenario subproblems in the master. To investigate the benefits of this methodology, we apply it to solve a general class of two-stage stochastic multicommodity network design models. Specifically, we solve the challenging variant of the model where both the demands and the arc capacities are stochastic. Through an extensive experimental campaign, we clearly show that the proposed methodology yields significant benefits in computational efficiency, solution quality, and stability of the solution process.},

A multi-commodity capacitated single-period version of this problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. A solution technique based on Benders Decomposition is developed, implemented, and successfully applied to a real problem for a major food firm with 17 commodity classes, 14 plants, 45 possible distribution center sites, and 121 customer zones. An essentially optimal solution was found and proven with a surprisingly small number of Benders cuts. Some discussion is given concerning why this problem class appears to be so amenable to solution by Benders' method, and also concerning what we feel to be the proper professional use of the present computational technique.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes methodology for improving the performance of Benders decomposition when applied to mixed integer programs. It introduces a new technique for accelerating the convergence of the algorithm and theory for distinguishing ``good'' model formulations of a problem that has distinct but equivalent mixed integer programming representations. The acceleration technique is based upon selecting judiciously from the alternate optima of the Benders subproblem to generate strong or pareto-optimal cuts. This methodology also applies to a much broader class of optimization algorithms that includes Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition for linear and nonlinear programs and related ``cutting plane'' type algorithms that arise in resource directive and price decomposition. When specialized to network location problems, this cut generation technique leads to very efficient algorithms that exploit the underlying structure of these models. In discussing the ``proper'' formulation of mixed integer programs, we suggest criteria for comparing various mixed integer formulations of a problem and for choosing formulations that can provide stronger cuts for Benders decomposition. From this discussion intimate connections between the previously disparate viewpoints of strong Benders cuts and tight linear programming relaxations of integer programs emerge.}

In this paper a modified algorithm for solving Problem P is proposed, in which the solution of a sequence of integer programs is replaced by the solution of a sequence of linear programs plus some (hopefully few) integer programs. The modified algorithm will still allow for taking advantage of any special structures (e.g., an LP subproblem that is a ``network problem'') just as in Benders' original algorithm. The modified Benders' algorithm is explained and limited computational results are given.},
