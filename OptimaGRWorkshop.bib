  abstract = {Network design problems concern the selection of arcs in a graph in order to satisfy, at minimum cost, some flow requirements, usually expressed in the form of origin\textendash destination pair demands. Benders decomposition methods, based on the idea of partition and delayed constraint generation, have been successfully applied to many of these problems. This article presents a review of these applications.},

  abstract = {Solving multicommodity capacitated network design problems is a hard task that requires the use of several strategies like relaxing some constraints and strengthening the model with valid inequalities. In this paper, we compare three sets of inequalities that have been widely used in this context: Benders, metric and cutset inequalities. We show that Benders inequalities associated to extreme rays are metric inequalities. We also show how to strengthen Benders inequalities associated to non-extreme rays to obtain metric inequalities. We show that cutset inequalities are Benders inequalities, but not necessarily metric inequalities. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a cutset inequality to be a metric inequality. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of strengthening Benders and cutset inequalities to obtain metric inequalities.},

  abstract = {A commonly occurring problem in distribution system design is the optimal location of intermediate distribution facilities between plants and customers. A multi-commodity capacitated single-period version of this problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. A solution technique based on Benders Decomposition is developed, implemented, and successfully applied to a real problem for a major food firm with 17 commodity classes, 14 plants, 45 possible distribution center sites, and 121 customer zones. An essentially optimal solution was found and proven with a surprisingly small number of Benders cuts. Some discussion is given concerning why this problem class appears to be so amenable to solution by Benders' method, and also concerning what we feel to be the proper professional use of the present computational technique.},

  abstract = {The Benders decomposition algorithm has been successfully applied to a wide range of difficult optimization problems. This paper presents a state-of-the-art survey of this algorithm, emphasizing its use in combinatorial optimization. We discuss the classical algorithm, the impact of the problem formulation on its convergence, and the relationship to other decomposition methods. We introduce a taxonomy of algorithmic enhancements and acceleration strategies based on the main components of the algorithm. The taxonomy provides the framework to synthesize the literature, and to identify shortcomings, trends and potential research directions. We also discuss the use of the BD to develop efficient (meta-)heuristics, describe the limitations of the classical algorithm, and present extensions enabling its application to a broader range of problems.},
