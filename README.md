Title:  Benders Decomposition Tutorial

Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) is a highly effective method for solving optimisation problems. The remarkable progress made by MIP solvers such as CPLEX and GUROBI in the last three decades has resulted in the widespread use of the technique as a black-box approach for various industrial applications. All that is required of the practitioner is to formulate the problem as a mixed-integer programming model, and the solver takes care of the rest.

However, the complexity of some industrial applications exceeds the capabilities of these solvers. In order to advance the use of MIP, decomposition techniques are a popular approach. These methods divide the problem into smaller sub-problems that can be efficiently handled by the solvers. Benders decomposition is one of the most successful techniques in this regard.

The purpose of this workshop is to provide an introduction to the main concepts of Benders decomposition in a user-friendly manner. Participants will receive a hands-on tutorial on implementing an algorithm for a toy problem, which will serve as a gentle introduction to the technique. In the second part of the workshop, we will discuss recent advances in the field and demonstrate how the technique can be applied to solve large-scale industrial problems.

Please note that participants are required to bring their laptops and register for an account at Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/) in order to participate in the hands-on portion of the workshop. (Or have access to Gurobi installed on their computer)
