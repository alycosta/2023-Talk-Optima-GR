Title:  Benders Decomposition Tutorial

Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) is a highly effective method for solving optimisation problems. The remarkable progress made by MIP solvers such as CPLEX and GUROBI in the last three decades has resulted in the widespread use of the technique as the approach of choice for tackling many industrial applications.

The complexity of some industrial applications exceeds the capabilities of these solvers. In order to advance the use of MIP, decomposition techniques are a popular approach. These methods divide the problem into smaller sub-problems that fall into the solvers reach. Benders decomposition is one of the most successful techniques in this regard.

In this workshop, we provide a gentle introduction to the core concepts of Benders decomposition. This includes a hands-on tutorial on implementing an algorithm for a toy problem. In the second part of the workshop, we will discuss recent advances in the field and exemplify how the technique can be applied to solve large-scale industrial problems.

Participants are requested to bring their laptops and register for an account at Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/) in order to participate in the hands-on tutorial.
